I've been pretty out of shape in the past, and the things I find fun weren't all that fun.  Work out to live better, not longer!\n\nBut also, genetics are a bitch.  My grandpa had a massive heart attack at 49, and one about every 5 years thereafter until he died at 75 from a stroke.  He was always in great shape.  He really focused in on the diet after that, but they still kept coming.  The thing is, if he were in bad shape, it might have happened at 39 instead of 49.  And he was climbing mountains, running rivers, scuba diving and skiing until he died -- on the top of a mountain, actually.  BTW, my other grandpa hasn't worked out a minute in his life, very sedentary, huge pot belly.  Still kicking at 88.  But his life is boring as hell -- all TV and food.\n\nAlso, I'd be willing to bet that Mr. Harper has included his fair share of 'supplements' in his training, which probably doesn't help."}

As a \"I don't know anything about 3d printing\" software, it will keep you out of trouble. If you are a prosumer, use (insert software of choice) to generate your Gcode and import it into the XYZware just to post it to the machine. I really like the printer, but it isn't the quickest. You may need to check the belt tensions and tighten them really as much as you can. The polycarb case is not hard to remove (to do any repairs). I have found the bed leveling procedure to work maybe %50 of the time, make sure the little probe is super clean. Note on that is the probe is actually a little screw, which can come loose after some prints. It needs to be tightly screwed in to work correctly. It isn't too hard to manually level though. Check the wiring for the upper gantry, it is fairly lazily assembled, and some wires/the bowden rub against the walls and roof. Get some zipties or wireties or something and get them out of the way. I have found the pneumatic couplers (repurposed to hold the bowden tube in place) to fail if you bork with them a bunch, they are cheap to replace if necessary. I am very pleased with the printer personally. Mine worked well out of the box, I have it configured wirelessly, but I have it banned by my router from internet access. I am not sure if it is in fact sending anything out at all, but I'm not giving it any chances. Some people have had the memory give out, Inside the back cover is the circuit board which uses a cheapo 2 gig microSD for memory. You shouldn't need to replace it straight away, but I would back up all the files it has to your computer in case it goes and you have to replace it with another, should prevent it from being bricked.

However, if you're caught with a small amount on you, you can: sign a disclaimer form (essentially voluntarily giving up ownership) receive a slap on the wrist and go on with your day: or not sign aforementioned disclaimer form, have your weed seized off you and get prosecuted.\n\nThe there's the coffeeshop^1. Unfer certain conditions, the police and prosecution service act as if they didn't see anything (cause weed is illegal, remember?). That is, regarding the sale of weed. However, coffeeshops do need to be supplied in order to, well, basically continue to exist. The suppliers do get prosecuted, so tough shit \ud83d\ude1b there's actually been a court case against a couple who did run a supply business and did everything by the book (ie. paid their taxes and all) and they were found guilty, but received no punishment, because of this government policy.\n\nTL;DR: weed is legal except that it isn't.\n\n^1 coffee ship vs coffeeshop.

The general gist that I am getting is that 'DSA' is in fact very important for interviews. Like I said I have quite a while before I would even consider applying anywhere and I am not in a big rush or anything, but I will get started now. I am thinking of allocating an hour and a half a day every day for the next year to go over the topic. That way I still have time to do other more fun coding activities such as making games/breaking my computer. Maybe I can try applying what I learn to stuff I make, because right now I see no need to implement any of these things outside of some useful recursive algorithms where iteration is just not feasible. I know the absolute basics and from what I can tell, while by no means easy the material isn't rocket science either.

They keep the business going which both employs people and, in most cases, creates a product people want. \n\nObviously the decisions start from a point of self interest. That's what you get with capitalism. Won't deny that. But saying that the mutual interest with others including their employees seems to overlook the majority of business decisions. \n\n&gt;history has, of course, shown that positive reforms never last, and that is why reformism is futile; that is another topic however\n\nHistory seems to be showing the opposite. The idea of a financial crime didn't even used to exist. Social safety nets, continued public investment, and ethics oversight in government are all relatively recent creations. I'd be interested to know what point in time you think these things existed in a more effective and/or widespread level than they do today. \n\n&gt;Of course, no one is denying that there was a time when the bourgeois played a progressive role, but that time is, in general at least a century past.\n\nMaybe in Europe. The Bourgeois in America didn't give less of a fuck about regular people around ~1870-1900 than maybe at any greater time  in our history. Today, if you want to find socialists or people with political views sympathetic to that, go to the American Bourgeois. You certainly won't find it in the working class today.\n\n&gt;The original point of bringing this up was to make the point that there would always be people willing to do whatever work was socially necessary. Do you disagree with that?\n\nNo I don't disagree with that in general, but I disagree that there will always be enough people who would make the personal choice to do that work instead of some other work, should the choice be given to them. I don't see janitors becoming more popular under socialism for the \"abstract\" reasons we got into. Because I don't think those reasons are particularly abstract. Impressionistic, maybe, to use the art metaphor, but not abstract. \n\n&gt;The Natural Resources Defense Council says 40%, and even the USDA says \"food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply\".\n\nThat is pretty significant. Obviously a big problem. My first thought is that I don't understand how food producers can make a profit if 30-40% of their product isn't sold, which leads me to wonder then how much of the waste occurs at the wholesale vs retail vs consumer level. Or more specifically, how it can be feasible for a business to lose so many sales but still make a profit. I agree this is a problem, I'm still curious as to whether this is a capitalist problem or a refrigeration problem. \n\nBut then the question becomes, why can one be so sure that communism would fix this? \n\n&gt;What sort of system, if you don't mind me asking?\n\nI don't currently support any core fundamental changes so long as the system continues to expand the percentage of people who see increased material benefit over time, which is currently the case. I support more public assistance spending, more public jobs programs, more public healthcare, more regulation of large corporations, etc... I'm in favor of unions coming back stronger though for whatever reason workers don't seem to care enough about that so I'll follow their lead. I also think a huge amount of problems faced by \"lower classes\" today are a function of corrupt and uncaring local authorities that prey on people, so I think that a number of civic reforms need to be put into place to ensure that people who are less well off live in less fear. I think that the current system with it's flaws is the most successful one we've had, and that the best way forward is to make continual moderate upgrades to it. \n\nI'm open to hearing about alternative systems, but my belief is that the current capitalist framework is the only \"system\" ever devised that actually proved to work (generate continual results for majorities). Everything before this has been random authoritarianism, rise and fall of empires, golden ages and dark ages, all at a torturous baseline medievalist standard of living. Anything before 1850 may as well be 1850 BC for all I care.  \n\n(As an aside, I think much of the current Liberal angst over economics is unintentionally hypocritical, because it's decrying income inequality within America while ignoring how income inequality between America and everyone else has helped contribute to that. One of the more curious gripes I've seen fellow liberal Americans take up lately is making common cause with conservatives that foreigners are \"taking our jobs\", i.e. American workers can't compete in a globalized marketplace. And I'm just here like... ok... so you're mad that these opportunities for better lives that still don't approach American standards of living are going to poor people in other countries and not people of your nationality... any *you're* supposed to be the selfless liberal here?)\n\n&gt;In the core regions, certainly. In the periphery, not so much.\n\nThis will always be the case with everything. That's part of the definition of \"periphery\". They get things second. Not because they don't matter, but because of the geographical or social realities that make them the periphery. The goal should be to shrink the distance to them, not just pretend there is no distance to shrink. \n\n&gt;However, the time of capitalism being a progressive force passed long ago.\n\nI guess I can agree with that, in that I can't really imagine capitalism being a progressive force. It's a materialist force. Maybe back in Adam Smith's time this was rock star stuff, cutting edge and exciting. But no, Capitalism is a management strategy, not a structure for civil society. It's a means of primarily growing and secondarily distributing wealth. Progressivism today is mostly coming from other places. \n\nHowever you can't ignore the fundamental gamble. That's the idea that everything that has been built on this system is up for wager, should an actual fundamental change, a global revolution, occur. The test cases on hard communism don't look good overall, and don't make me feel inclined to wager everything on it's success. I see a lot of lessons to take from socialist/communist philosophy that should be implemented and continually experimented with, but I have a hard time understanding the logic of someone saying that the current state of affairs calls for overthrow, as opposed to cautious progressive management.

I think much of its difficulty is being able to adapt a narrow range of answers to a wide field. You don't have access to Decay, Bolt, or Pulse to get you out of sticky situations. Your \"best\" catch-all answer is a 3 mana sorcery that costs double white and only hits a single thing (whereas Pulse can get rid of multiples if there are any). The next best option is a mana-intensive artifact that requires you to expose yourself to Wasteland if you want to blow up anything with a CMC &gt;2, which can be often. Outside of those two cards, and often the *only* two cards in any list (1:1 split MD with no copies in the SB), your other answers are FoW, 1-2 CS, CB, and Terminus. FoW doesn't stop everything, nor should you use it as such, CS is often too slow in a format as fast as Legacy, CB is starting to lose much of its power to decks with more diverse CMCs, and Terminus only hits creatures, so in order to fight predominantly non-creature decks you need to go to the SB for such cards (REB is the main one usually). However, you can't grab REBs in game 1 so you need to adapt your playstyle if the deck you're facing doesn't attack along an axis that Miracles is well-equipped to deal with (aka creature beats).","score":2,"gilded":0,"author":"ReallyForeverAlone","subreddit":"MTGLegacy","parent_id":"t1_dea2ir4","distinguished":null}

{"controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_5wnvw7","author_flair_css_class":"fan fnatic","created_utc":1488326275,"body":"Fnatic got completely destroyed, and it's a downer because they are (or maybe *were*) my favorite team. It's hard to say what the problem is for them, specifically. They obviously have really great teamwork and coordination most of the time. Vonethil is known to be nearly peerless in shot calling, and is the team glue. I feel like Custa has been a complete god on both Ana and Zen when the team isn't getting roflstomped like this. Stoop is usually one of those tanks that gets a lot of kills off good earth shatters, so I can't see him being the problem. CoolMatt69 being on mostly Roadhog has been a step down from Buds doing it, who imo, was a godlike Hog for a while, but didn't look that great in recent times, so maybe that's why they swapped. But honestly, Buds on Hog with CoolMatt69 on Soldier looked kinda better than vice-versa. Though, Matt did get some 3-4ks in this series, but generally, I think he's better on Zarya, which he's *very* good at. \n\nSo that leaves the dps players, which a lot of people say lack star power. When IDDQD was on the roster, I thought Buds was amazing. Imo, he's *the* best Reaper, period. That hasn't mattered for a while, but it shows his positioning is good, and he's often the last man alive in team fights. He's been playing a lot of Tracer to mixed results. But a lot of that is about opening up space for your other damage dealers to capitalize, which I feel like isn't happening, so he gets focused down more than he should in these scenarios. Plus, when IDDQD was on the team, Buds was generally forced onto projectiles, which he isn't *as* comfortable on. But, his Genji was good, he played Hanzo sometimes, Pharah, Hog. I've seen him take games completely into his hands on Widow too. So, I have a hard time thinking he's really the problem. I guess I don't think he's a hard carry, but he's a core tenant of this roster, and I've never thought he wasn't stellar until very recently. Lastly, there's Hafficool, the newest addition; IDDQD's replacement. They brought him on for his flexibility, propensity for projectile heroes, and he played a great DVa last meta. I'm not sure I've really been impressed by him other than his DVa, and his Pharah against Complexity, which...it's Complexity, they have/had Pharah problems. I do find it odd how vocal he's been, saying NA teams are overrated, calling teams mid-tier, when currently, Fnatic looks like the most overrated NA team. But anyway, I just can't see how Haffi is on IDDQD's level, at all. Sure it allows Buds to play what he wants, but he looked better on heroes he was less comfortable on when IDD was on the team. \n\nI think it was never going to happen due to timing, but I reeeeally wanted to see Talespin join these guys. Pretty sure Talespin, Buds, and CoolMatt69 have history together, Talespin is great-godlike at the different projectile heroes, and he's a truly top dps player. He's not a Genji specialist, but he could always get better. At the same time, I don't want to jump on one player after one bad event (though they looked weak at NGE too...) and Roflgator has said they were looking great in scrims. It's hard to believe, based on how awful they looked in this tournament. I wish them well, but I don't know if they can reach the next level with this team.","gilded":0,"score":5,"parent_id":"t3_5wnvw7","subreddit":"Competitiveoverwatch","author":"Rattlehead2Deth","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":"","id":"decez6n","subreddit_id":"t5_34fcy","retrieved_on":1489223561,"stickied":false,"edited":false}

That doesn't mean it should be attacked and torn down.\n\n&gt; But not everyone can achieve it\n\nPerhaps because we as a society no longer teach people to value and foster these kinds of things. Everyone can achieve it, but when the value of relationships is placed on the wrong area - sex as opposed to intimacy, then the quality of the relationships will degrade. And progressives have done nothing to reinforce the concept of intimacy in relationships. Rather, they have conflated sex as intimacy, when they are not the same thing.\n\n&gt; The sexual revolution aimed to get appropriate sexualization in the media and society. \n\nThe problem is that what counts as appropriate was never clearly defined. It's a narrow edge to walk, and the movement strayed too far in the other direction. And progressives don't seem to care or realize this fact.\n\nDivorce rates have been high for quite some time, and in many of these relationships, children are involved. I think we can both agree that a divorce is not good for child development. And yet the progressive movement has been silent on it.\n\n&gt; How can we stop the hypersexualization problem? Same way we curtail binge drinking in college: stop being such fucking prudes and drink/fuck responsibly\n\nBut the thing is, if there is no external pressure to change, people won't change. That's just a general facet of people in general. We don't change unless we have to. And if there is no pressure to change, people won't. \n\nYou're correct in saying that hypersexualization is partly a marketing problem. If progressives don't like it, why don't they campaign for legislation to curtail that behaviour the same way they've curtailed for other legislation? I think they haven't because they don't really care."}

If staff can't find you out-of-area clinicians, consider filing a complaint with Illinois' insurance commissioner; in *theory*, your insurer can't make promises that there are clinicians without, y'know, actually *having* clinicians you can access. No guarantees that you'll get satisfactory results, but you may enjoy the satisfaction of having stuck it to The Man (no pun intended).\n\nRe: prescription drugs, keep in mind that insurance generally, health insurance specifically, emerges from a kinda-sorta Puritan mentality - you need health insurance for when you're really sick, and it's mostly up to you to avoid getting sick, unless you can afford a high-powered lobbyist who can buy you/your tribe \"most favored populace\" special coverage rules. Insurance isn't science, it's politics made contractual; everything is, or was, a negotiation. \n\nDrugs of the type you're describing are generally going to entail pretty steep copayments/coinsurance on your part.

Maybe then your 99% figure would make sense.\n\n&gt; Again I know you are a troll and not worth my time since you cannot do the most basic of basic research.\n\nIt's your point.

They should either add more tutorials or completely revamp it to provide more relevant and up to date information to the new players.\n\nAs for the base game, after playing my first campaign on it I feel like it really needs to have some of the features that are currently only available with DLCs. I have nothing against a company that has the tradition of using DLCs to get money providing new content, but this should not mean that you are forced to get these DLCs to enjoy the game. I say this because after my first campaign with the base game and my second and third with art of war and common sense it really feels like a new, less frustrating game for a newcomer. Some of the features of warfare added by art of war as well as the religious leagues and also the development provinces mechanic from common sense should be added to the base game.

There's no exact quota you can place on anyone but yourself. Frankly, bigger people with physically exhausting jobs or hobbies could eat a lot more meat (without real health blowback), and put it to good use, compared to a smaller person working a desk job. And everyone's nutritional needs are unique to some degree based on their genetic history (ex. why europeans can digest dairy more effectively) I don't think eating meat is such a bad thing in itself. It's the excess on a societal level. I think the productive necessities of feeding 350 millionish (North America speaking) people who almost all treat meat as the core of their diet, included as the centre of every meal, are brutal, unsustainable and inhumane. I think if we, as a relatively affluent society, could treat meat as a treat which requires a live sacrifice, we could consume at levels which would permit the competitive operation of small family farms, hobby farms etc., and do away with industrial feed lots, killing floors, growth hormone injections, as well as rampant heart disease and blood pressure problems. I think that's an easier bridge to informing people about the downsides of meat consumption, because when they hear all meat eating is bad, they tune out real fast, almost as if to a religious lecture. Black and white solutions like vegetarianism and veganism are not gonna do it in my view, because everyone should be able to practice discretion according to their own will. Sugar is bad for you, but nobody goes around saying 'I don't eat sugar, you shouldn't either.' Same goes for any potential vice, anything that can be overdone. I'm with you in that you should just be an informed example of what you think is right. I disagree on the 'moral superiority' equivalency between saying that meat eating is flat out wrong, and suggesting that people in general are eating way too much of it. -sorry for the way too long and probably somewhat off-topic extended paragraph response that I think amounts to just splitting hairs","gilded":0,"score":1,"parent_id":"t1_deb7d0l","subreddit":"bestof","author":"papawarbucks","distinguished":null,"controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_5w69h8","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1488326291}

This way, if carbon DOES cause heating on the scale leftists believe, we have a thriving job market in clean energy which we spent 50 years building up responsibly, if not, then we still have a thriving job market that has access to infinite resource production (fossil fuels will run out within 200 years anyway).

Most full time min wage workers do not qualify for a low income health care card, they are up for a gap fee. \n\nFor some reason the powers that be made life worse for the poor claiming we couldn't afford it while the rich got richer. \n\nIf it were true that we couldn't afford the support to the poor wouldn't everyone in society have gotten poorer on average in the last ten years?\n\nWe are undergoing a wind back of 20th century progression and a wealth transfer from rich to poor. Those who couldn't innovate to make money simply decided to take it from the rest. \n\n","score":30,"gilded":0,"author":"mistyrain001","parent_id":"t1_decen3a","subreddit":"australia","distinguished":null,"id":"decezpk","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh8e","stickied":false,"retrieved_on":1489223568,"edited":false}

{"gilded":0,"score":3,"body":"I was sexually abused once as a child. I never realised it bothered me at all. I guess because like you say, when you're child you can't really process something like that. I developed PTSD a couple of years ago (I'm now in my mid 20's) and had an 'emotional flashback' so I basically felt what I should have felt at the time of the original trauma when I was a child but I guess I had suppressed. I had no idea it was related to that though. I had another 'emotional flashback' from something which happened (which subconsciously reminded me of what happened when I was a child) and had 'acute PTSD' for at least a year. I only realised after a year of having all those PTSD symptoms that it was actually connected to what happened when I was a child, well I didn't even realise, I basically had to be told. \n\nI didn't really experience any symptoms as a child like you did. Apart from of course my schizoid nature but I think that was there already. I've always been very passive, just let people do what they want to me, weak boundaries and not feeling like I have needs. But I think those are traits of my CPTSD, SPD and were likely in place before the sexual assault when I was about 7 or so. I guess it's all sort of connected though. Although I think even as a children I would have a strong aversion and avoidance on occasion of certain men (who likely reminded me of the man who abused) but the rest of my aversion to people was just my schizoid traits. Later as a teenager I had a lot of suppressed anger (and I still do) but again I think that's due more to CPTSD stuff. \n\nBut when I was at college and a bit before, I went through a phase of being quite sexually promiscuous. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but looking back now I realise I also had not much self respect or idea of my body being my own etc. I think it was a lot to do with the fact that everyone I knew was like that at college though. I also used to let people do little things like kissing me sexually and tying me up etc. when I didn't want them to. \n\nThen after I developed PTSD I became repulsed by sex. Although I've always hated people talking about sex so some of that was there before as it's just my character to dislike when people are lewd about it etc. I then started to hate the thought of doing it too. Even with my boyfriend who I loved. Nowadays my PTSD is not so acute so I could have sex with someone special who I was commited to. But I would never have sex with anyone else again. Anyway I've heard going from one extreme to the other like that is common for victims of sexual abuse. It's hard for me to talk about too. \n\nI'm sorry that happened to you and everything that you've been through.

Clearly despite our intolerance we are singularly incapable of choosing leaders that will do anything about it. Doesn't bode well for our resilience against dictators.\n\n\nEither way, our supposed cultural characteristics likely make little difference. It just means that a potential dictator would require a different approach. Look at Trump for example; you can hardly say that the Yanks are particularly tolerant of rules and regulations, and that is exactly the platform that he played on to win the election. Fight for the lower classes - less regulation, less inequality, bring back jobs, make America great again! Hitler himself rode into power on the disaffection of the masses with their economic straits after WW1. Mao rode in on the platform of a communist society with no income inequality whatsoever!\n\nDictatorship, I would say, requires nothing more than a seething discontent in the populace and one charismatic person to tell them what they want to hear.","id":"decf0b2","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"retrieved_on":1489223577,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhcv"}

Most states allow the parent(s) to fill out information on their certificate such as name, parental information, but other information such as time and place of birth are written in and signed by staff.

I've heard cases where a couple were married for a couple of years and decided to get a divorce.  That court/state had a policy to give a paternity test when children were involved in a divorce.  Two out of the three children were proven to not be the husband's, something he never suspected.  Even though that was the case he still had to pay child support, school funds, and insurance for all the children because he acknowledged paternity and was a part of their lives for X amount of years.

Obviously, putting faith in physical things, like putting faith in a chair made of paper to hold your weight, or even putting your trust in someone you love, is risky, but I think that spiritual faith is different. I think as long as you view your faith as changeable and take everything with a grain of salt it can improve your life a lot. Of course, anything is possible, and that's kind of what makes it fun and cool! I don't necessarily believe in this though, or anything at all. I don't necessarily believe in this system, but my intuition ('feelings') really digs it and unlike, say Christianity's afterlife explanation, this one makes actual, logical sense to me, and unlike reincarnation in Hinduism and Buddhism, this one is more detailed and also makes more sense to me. For me, I don't think putting faith into this and having it scientifically proved wrong (which is pretty much impossible at this point) would be scary or unsettling, it would probably be more unsettling to me if it was proved right!\n\nI wouldn't say that I necessarily believe this, I just think that it seems like a viable system for an afterlife, and it's an interesting perspective to think about life through. \n\nIf you want more evidence-y evidence, this is an actual scientific article about reincarnation. https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/ian-stevensone28099s-case-for-the-afterlife-are-we-e28098skepticse28099-really-just-cynics/ \nYou'll notice that Stevenson only found \"proof\" of past lives of people who were reincarnated immediately, and close-by to the previous life, I think that is because when you die suddenly and young (like all those people did) you need to come back close by to fulfill the purposes you were supposed to fill in the life that was cut too short.\n\nAnd I'd love to hear whatever anecdotal evidence you have!

{"score":2,"gilded":0,"body":"Read your teammates and what they're doing. If you're playing with a pre-made team you should already know their playing habits. I have a buddy I play with a lot that is prone to not roating, but he's a god at being able to clutch near the net by himself, so I'll tend to know my place on the field, go back a little to mid field (in case I need to revert to being goalie , or clean up a pass he makes for me).\n\nOr, if I'm playing solo in 2s or 3s I know to play more defensice at beginning of game to see how the teammates are. If I see the are rotating I will find the correct groove. \n\nRotating is all about knowing where your teammates are and trying to predict what and where they will be. \n\nEven try to learn quickly how the other team is. If they're trying to set up aerials most of everytime they have ball control on your side of the map, make sure there is a goalie at all times then. If you find nobody on your team is in net, then get there. \n\nMy favorotire rotation in 3s is where everyobdy always has boost. If the ball is on opponents side, and I go up for a goal attempt I'll generally use most of my boost. If I don't goal, and ball is still in our control on their side of the map, the idea is I'll rotate back to mid/back field to get boost and the other teammate that was already back there will push forward taking my position. \n\nSo, idea 3s rotation is , while in offense mode, 2 cars are trying to goal, and there is 1 guy somewhere in midfield ready to either go back to goal to be goalie, or take the place of one of the cars who wants to rotate out for more boost (that car would take the mid-field position)\n\nA ball chaser is somebody who doesn't rotate and is always in offesnse mode. They would be trying to goal, run out of boost, go mid field to get boost, then go right back to trying to goal instead of reading that the other teammate had taken their spot and not going to mid.

So needless to say his combat experience dwarfs iron mans and caps.\n\nWell, that's not wrong.\n\nIt's not really much of an advantage though.\n\n&gt; As for his durability he tanked the explosion of Vegas central processing facility, a facility that takes 2.4 terawatts of power (around 2 million times that of a nuclear generator) to power, and produced enough heat to make the facility 173 times hotter than the surface of the sun. He stood in the very center of it and detonated it. The ensuing explosion tore open a hole in reality. He survived without even a scratch. \n\nI, uh, might be wrong but... wasn't the point of destroying Vega creating the portal? They needed the 2.4 terawatts of power to create the portal. It wasn't so powerful that it \"tore a hole in reality\", IIRC they directed it towards The Well.\n\nSeems more like he survived the destruction of Vega, which created a portal to Hell.\n\n&gt; As for his strength hes crushed obsidian bare handed, and this was before he received his armor which greatly augmented his power\n\nObsidians not exactly known for being super durable. And even then, you're probably using the vague text of him smashing obsidian pillars with his might.\n\nAnd even *then*, that's not greater than Iron Man.\n\n&gt; The stronger demons like barons, mancubus, the cyberdemon, and the hellguard survive ordinance that dwarfs even what modern armored vehicles can put out and doomguy can rip them apart with ease. Here is a link to the hellguards fight. They stand up to all of his ordinance and he simply rips them apart and punches a hole in their armor.\n\nFirst of all, you're basing their durability off of game mechanics. You could probably kill most of the enemies by shooting their foot hundreds of times.\n\nSecond, that video is showing Doomguy needing to deplete their health bar. Even if the gameplay was representative of their durability, it's very likely they were weakened after getting shot up for several minutes by a variety of future guns. That's if we accept gameplay, of course.\n\nSo we've established that\n\n* Doomguy has more experience.\n\n* Survived a portal to Hell\n\n* Smashed Obsidian Pillars, of unknown size.\n\n* Has punched through hell guards bone armour with three hits.\n\nMeanwhile Iron Man has a suit capable of analyzing a persons fighting style.\n\nSurvived a portal to space. Has a petawatt laser (which is bull, but I figured I might as well throw out one of his bigger numbers).\n\nPunched titanium Hammertech robots apart. Gone toe to toe with Thor, the same guy that can tackle \"Hulks\" through metal bulkheads, and hits hard enough to toss fighter jets.\n\nIron Man is certainly faster. He's certainly stronger. At best you could argue Doomguy is more durable with that \"explosion\" but that's stretching it."}

What type of jobs will these immigrants have?  Probably none.  these poor people are totally being used.  These fly by celebrities should protest the united States and Mexico's agriculture industry and the United States Restaurant industry for paying these poor migrants pennies.\n\nOf all the groups living in poverty, the migrant farmworker and his family in general suffer the greatest socioeconomic deprivation. The migrant farmworker and his family travels throughout the Nation, living from day to day, depending upon his luck that the crops are good and that nothing happens, for instance, while he travels on the road. \n\nHim and his family will eat as little and as cheap as he can, for he has very little money to get there. If his car breaks down, the mechanics overcharge him as much as they feel they can get away with. Because of bad weather and the time that laps between each crop, it is impossible for him to save any money\u2014plus the high cost of living, plus the excessive amount of rent that he has to pay for the rat and roach infested pigpen that him and his family are forced to live in while he lives in Florida. \n\nSo when crops are over in the State of Florida, there is no way that he can continue to survive, so he migrates. And because of that the migrant farmworkers have had great difficulties in their employment relationships, much of this arising out of exploitation and abuse by irresponsible farmers and crew leaders who sometimes underpay them, short count them, and overcharge them for transportation. Crew leaders on occasions, collect wages from the employers and then abandon the workers without paying them.\nhttp://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/7024\nMexican Farmers Hammered by NAFTA\n\nMexico's poor farmers hurt by NAFTA, economist says \nBy Lourdes Medrano, Arizona Daily Star \nWed Aug 31, 4:40 AM ET \n\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement may have boosted big business, but it has had a disastrous effect on Mexicans, a Chiapas economist said.\nhttps://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/Politics/nafta090605.php\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/wendys-workers-will-lose-jobs-to-robots-2016-5\n\n\n","distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t1_dece23i","subreddit":"comicbooks","author":"metalrubber","author_flair_text":null,"id":"decf0lh","stickied":false,"retrieved_on":1489223580,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhon","edited":false}

He stopped working for Mercedes in the capacity he was but they held onto him contractually which stopped him from working with Williams sooner. This is done partly to stop employees bringing this potential information to the new team. So what I'm saying is that is some ex Mercedes employee is making this claim, it's potentially not valid as they would probably contractually not be allowed to leave till their contract is over and Mercedes are stupid enough to have a contract end at a point that would allow employees to learn valuable technical info and then leave to another team.

I prefer Image, Darkhorse, IDW, indies, etc. lately, but I still think that maybe 50% of comic readers I know would buy reworks of older comics. I have no idea how that translates into a potential market.\n\nAs a single-publication graphic novel release, some of the deadline pressure could be alleviated.

That just seems like work as usual. \n\n&gt; every choice you make would be contested by some fans\n\nIf this was an actual blocker for producing creative content, we wouldn't have ANY comics let alone what I'm proposing. This didn't stop movies from bringing old stories into a modern age. Why not at least try this within the same medium? \n\nObviously, if anybody actually prefers/likes older comics, then what I'm proposing may just seem like a net negative since it just uses up creative resources for something unnecessary. \n\nAfterall, how many times have comics retold the same story under different creative teams? Maybe what I'm asking for has already been done, just not so openly. We have multiple \"Hulk is smashing\" stories. We have multiple \"Joker is giving Batman a hard time\" stories. We've definitely already seen Stan Lee/Jack Kirby stories re-worked, paid homage to, borrowed from, refered to, etc. ad nauseum. So, what am I asking for...

The Oxford dictionary also acquiesced and changed the word \"literally\" to also mean \"figuratively\".

People use \"literally\" as an intensifier, so that's how the dictionary defines it. Language changes meaning, that's why we're not all speaking proto-indo-european.

Not even going into the whole difference between gender and sex, it's not a binary. \n\n&gt;Everything in humans is controlled by hormones determined by those sex chromosomes.

You either identify with the same gender as your sex or you don't. \n\n&gt; Saying things like feelings of transgender is normal is like telling me being born albino is normal.\n\nWhat should we do instead? The most effective treatment for gender identity disorder is transitioning. And what harm does it do to you to acknowledge trans people?\n\n\nAnd as for the intelligence thing, people subconsciously filter information to conform to their biases. For example, you ignore what gender means in a scientific context.

You'll find a rhythm and learn when to move without hesitation and how to shoot someone back into a bunker in order to make a move. Grab a buddy and gun fight from opposite bunkers making sure you don't come out in the same spot but work on snap-shooting and angles. This will help with repetition. Hug tightly to a wall/bunker in order to show less of yourself is pretty obvious, buuuutttt you can play farther away from a bunker to expose more of the field, this will give you a different look of a bunker and still allow you to stay in cover.

Another hour passed before a different customs officer came in.\n\n&gt; \u201cYour visa says you are a software engineer. Is that correct?\u201d the officer asked Omin in a tone the engineer described as accusatory. **When Omin said it was right, the officer presented him with a piece of paper and a pen and told him to answer the following questions**: \u201cWrite a function to check if a Binary Search Tree is balanced.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cEvery single time I asked [the official] why he was asking me these questions, he hushed me.

He has a few minutes of opening questions about job (even in intense interviews and stretching the definition of \"a few minutes\", that's only time enough for background/language/frameworks/projects/opinions/preferences), and then an hour of either sitting quietly and/or answering non-technical questions before the BST-bomb gets dropped.\n\nIf I walked into a JS dev interview and the *only real questions* were about balancing a binary tree from memory and abstract classes, I would say that interview was not even remotely appropriate. Most job interviews would take *hours* of probing questions to work towards anything so far out of scope, and it's even more abnormal for a knowledgeable interviewer to not handle follow-up questions - anyone who understands development knows that it's highly unusual to implement BSTs by hand from memory, and that JS doesn't have abstract classes.\n\nPlus, there's a lot of emphasis about his lack of preparedness, and based on their direct quotes, there's no way you could reasonably claim the interviewers made allowances for this.","gilded":0,"score":3,"parent_id":"t1_dec2l12","subreddit":"coding","author":"name_censored_","distinguished":null,"controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_5wpdms","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1488326335}

And what's these actual scholarly articles you've read? What are they called? Who wrote them? What data did they use and how was it collected? What were their biases? And you're done conversing with me? Because you don't like that what I'm saying doesn't correspond to the little boxes of what your preconceived and conceived notions are based on what you've *read*, and you can't handle anything to the contrary? Oh and one last thing: YOU DONT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK ON ANY OF THIS WHATSOEVER IF YOU ARENT ACTUALLY A JEW. referencing academic studies you've read as your right to speak about it just makes you look like dumb af, so telling me I look dumb af is quite rich. As an actual minority of whom you are speaking of but have never actually experienced, I can say whatever the fuck I want in telling you you have no rights to speak on this. Just like I'm sure you'd be up in arms about a white person speaking for a black persons experience based on academic journals they read.

My point is my personal experiences with those who identify with the right have been worse than with the left. The left might still have certain racist thoughts said certain racist things, but I and others have had serious racist actions happen to us from the right. \n\n&gt;This is the definition I subscribe to. \n\nYes most people who believed that non-white were inferior were right leaning. They would assume the most random things despite plenty of contrary evidence. The children of liberals were much better than the children of right. I grew up with both sides around me. \n\n&gt;It seems like, while you recognize that, you still let these \"anecdotes\" control your perception\n\nYes because this is what I have experienced. Are you trying to say I'm wrong for noticing what has happened to me or around me? That maybe the Republican staff member at my college that was caught saying \"I'd rather hire a trained monkey than a nigger\" or the other Republican staff member who is also a feminist saying \"Blacks just aren't smart\" aren't going to add up? The liberal staff creating a safe space for Blacks students? The liberal who stood up to a professor who used an offensive Asian accent? Unfortunately in my area people don't have a problem attacking minorities. We have some prominent white supermacist organizations near by. And they usually are Republican or they don't identify with liberals. Same with being mixed myself, those who tend to have problems with my parent's union were Republicans. Btw I have too many stories to tell. For me and my family/friends we tend to avoid certain individuals and I have less problems because of it. \n\n\n&gt;Also, anecdotal evidence goes both ways. \n\nIt sure does. I never said you couldn't avoid liberals nor that liberals can't be racist. I have dealt with racist liberals. \n\n\n&gt;most acts of terrorism are committing by Muslims \n\nSource?  http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/8718000\n\n&gt;Regarding the KKK's support of Trump and being historically right-leaning: saying that someone who supports Trump is racist and using the KKK's support of him as evidence \n\nYou just admitted  here that more serious racists tend to be right leaning. I never said all supporters of Trump were racist. However the white supermacist who tried to protest on my university campus? Right leaning. \n\n\n&gt;What I said was that your brand of divisiveness is just as bad. \n\nHas my brand of divisiveness resulted in the death of individuals? The death of children? Hate crimes? \n\n\nI see one being the lesser of 2 evils.

Regardless, I wasn't disputing that it required concentration, because the books are explicit in that regard. What you've been saying though, and what I've been disputing, is this:\n\n1. This means the Imp is literally casting the *Invisibility* spell, \n\n2. Because of (1) it can only maintain invisibility for one hour and\n\n3. Using its Shapechange breaks concentration\n\nAs to (1), if the Imp simply were to gain the ability to cast Invisibility, the stat block would say as much. Instead, it's a natural ability of the creature. That's pretty indisputable.\n\nOn point (2), even if we assume you're correct on (1), nothing in the Invisibility spell description implies that it cannot be recast while the caster is still invisible from a previous casting- it states that the affected target is invisible until the target \"attacks or casts a spell\" but since the spell is only a one-action casting, the ending of the first spell would coincide with the casting of the second.\n\nAnd the third. Concentration is only possibly broken under the following conditions (PHB203):\n\n- Casting another concentration spell\n\n- Taking damage\n\n- Being incapacitated or killed\n\nShapechange is not a concentration spell, being that it's not a spell at all and doesn't mention concentration in its description.

I'm sorry that you think contempt of court is something that people should just let slide because the perpetrator is a \"little old lady\", but the rule of law applies to everyone.\n\nBill Whatcott was an extremist who tried to use his right to religious freedom as a cover for willful hate speech.  Incidentally, this is the whole point behind \"reasonable limits\".  You have the right to worship and proselytize as you wish, but when it interferes with the rights of others you have a problem.\n\nSpeaking of reasonable limits, the entire section is as thus:  \"The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\"  Leaving out the final 16 words is disingenous as it creates a test.  These are not arbitrary limits, there is a legal reasoning process that must be undertaken in order to justify these limits.  \n\nBringing up section 33 is also disingenuous, since it has only ever been used in Quebec, either to prop up their culturally protective language laws or to simply thumb their nose at the federal government.  It does not function as a catch-all escape clause because it is political suicide to use the clause for anything but the most serious of reasons, again outside of Quebec. \n\n&gt;Even if the justices on the Supreme Court were interested in the individual right to free speech (they aren't)\n\nPlease outline your reasoned legal opinion on this rather serious allegation.\n\n&gt;So.....you'd best find another argument.\n\nNo, I think I'll stick with my original one.  The *Charter* is a progressive document that enshrines the fundamental rights of all Canadians while offering some of the strongest - if not *the* strongest - protections for minority rights in the Western world.  If you're bothered that the right to preach hatred is curtailed by it, oh well, maybe you should advocate that people should be allowed to spread hatred in the name of free speech.

It gives an excellent series of steps for tackling modern Javascript concepts one piece at a time: Javascript, React, ES6, and state management.\n\nOn that note, definitely don't over-complicate the learning process by trying to learn many different things at once. Some people will say you should use a \"boilerplate\" to learn React, and they're wrong - boilerplate projects almost always come with too many pieces configured, and are confusing for beginners.\n\nInstead, the best advice is to focus on learning React itself first. Once you have a good understanding of how React works, you will better appreciate why a state management library like Redux can be useful, and you can learn about other tools later.\n\nYou should start out by reading through the official React docs and tutorial at https://facebook.github.io/react/, and I'd encourage you to use the official Create-React-App tool ( https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app ) for setting up projects. It creates a project with a solid build setup, with no configuration needed on your part.\n\nPast that, I keep a big list of links to high-quality tutorials and articles on React, Redux, and related topics, at https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links . Specifically intended to be a great starting point for anyone trying to learn the ecosystem, as well as a solid source of good info on more advanced topics. It includes links for learning core Javascript (ES5), modern Javascript (ES6+), React, and much more.\n\nFinally, the Reactiflux chat channels on Discord are a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn.

When does that happen? Can someone die before the Holy Spirit had a chance to 'ask' that person?\n\nTo be clear, I disagree that it happens how you present it, if I understand it correctly.\n\n**Hebrews 10:16** - This is the covenant I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord:\n    \u2018I will put my laws in their hearts,\n    and I will write them upon their minds\n\nThe Holy Spirit doesn't 'come down and ask'. We already have a pull towards God that he have us. We are born with it. The Holy Spirit can work through us, but its not a separate event that pulls us to God.\n\n&gt;But when a person says YES, (that is, by believing that the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ was sufficient to pay for your sins,) then that person is born AGAIN (2nd time,) of The Spirit.\n\nWe've been through this, but I disagree here still. Verbally expressing belief is one thing and is important, but baptism is where the person is born again. I've already provided you with verses supporting that too. I can link them again if you'd like.\n\n&gt;Yes absolutely.\n\nThat's pretty interesting. How do you *really* know then? Can you actually know? I'd wager there have been plenty of people who would have swore up and down that they were saved and going to Heaven, but then turned away from God at a later date. How could they have felt so strongly, but then turn away?\n\n&gt;You are a \"new creation\" in Christ. Going back to some other religion, falling away, or becoming an Atheist will not even cross your mind lol.\n\nHow do you interpret the following\n\n**Mathew 5:21-22** - You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, \u2018You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.\u2019 But I say to you, whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment, and whoever says to his brother, \u2018Raqa,\u2019 will be answerable to the Sanhedrin, and whoever says, \u2018You fool,\u2019 will be liable to fiery Gehenna.\n\nFor the one who says 'you fool', what does that punishment Jesus gives mean to you?\n\n**Mathew 5:29-30** - If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into Gehenna. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body go into Gehenna.\n\nIf we are saved, why should we be cutting off the sinful parts of us lest we be punished for them?\n\n**Mathew 10:28** - And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.\n\nWho is the one who can destroy both body and soul?","score":1,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1488326356,"author_flair_css_class":"cath","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_5rg7g0","edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh6c","retrieved_on":1489223590,"stickied":false,"id":"decf1bs","author_flair_text":"Roman Catholic"}

As noted by Anton Minkov, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the regions with the largest Muslim population tended to be those in the eastern half of the Balkans: Thrace, eastern and southern Bulgaria, and northern Greece.^1 By the 1830s the population of the Balkans was between 33 and 42% Muslim, not just concentrated in the regions which still have large Muslim populations nowadays.^2 But as the borders of the Ottoman Empire shrank the Muslim population either fled or was ethnically cleansed. The Muslims of Serbia largely fled once that country gained autonomy in 1830, moving instead to Kosovo and Macedonia. Most of the Muslims of Bulgaria likewise fled or were forced out once independence was achieved, leading to the exile of 574,000 of them  between 1880 and 1945.^3 The Muslims of Greece were forcibly transferred to Turkey by mutual agreement between the two countries in 1923, uprooting some 500,000 people, in addition to those who had already fled the country. The 20th century Ottoman Empire (and subsequently Turkey) was thus a country flooded with millions of Muslim refugees both from the Balkans and the Russian Empire and continued to receive them in even greater numbers after the conclusion of the Balkan Wars of 1912-3. A significant proportion of the modern Turkish population are their descendants. Albania, Kosovo, and Bosnia happen to be the places where the Ottoman-era Muslim population has survived, but Muslims certainly used to exist elsewhere as well.\n\n1.

If you wouldn't mind sharing more, I have a few questions for ya:\n\n&gt; 1) A horse that shows speed and stays within 2 lengths of the leader at every call to the top of the stretch and then fades in his last race will often win his next race, especially when he is re-entered in the same class or a very slight rise in class. \n\nVery interesting, why is this? And by fade, how many lengths back is too much? How many prior races in that class and distance with this result before you decide a horse just doesn't have it? And I know its always a good thing regardless, but would you say a positive jockey change with a horse that has shown this type of history would be a particularly hard angle?\n\n&gt; 3)The only other angle that I look for on a consistent basis is the 4th race back after a layoff. This is the angle I used for many years that produced many longshot winners. Simply put, it simply requires looking at the last 3 month or longer break a horse has. Then count up to his 4th race and you will usually find a live longshot if he has shown any improvement at all in his second or third race.\n\nI had always been told to look for the 3rd race after a layoff, so thanks for sharing that, will make me take a harder look. How much of a layoff is too long for you? Ideal time period? How much stock do you put into how well a horse did coming back from a similar prior layoff in their history, and similarly, the trainers' percentage of ITM when coming back from that specific time period? I always wonder how often those percentages are random luck, when it comes to the otherwise average trainers.","gilded":0,"score":1,"parent_id":"t1_de95f9e","subreddit":"horseracing","author":"evannnn67","distinguished":null}

So, which mammal do you think most closely resembles a tortoise in that regard?\n\n&gt; They are usually given too much space to roam in, and pens with a lot of stimulation like slopes, rocks etc. \n\nThere's no such thing as too much space for a tortoise enclosure. ;)  \nSeriously, most enclosures that I see are too small rather than too big, including my own. And what's wrong with stimulation? All pets should have that. Did you ever have birds, particularly of the parrot order? They aren't mammals either, but crave attention and stimulation.  \nSlopes and rocks aren't just for stimulation either. Tortoises use them to optimally orientate their bodies/shells for basking, for example. And a tortoise that somehow got flipped on its back will have a better chance of righting itself there than on flat, empty terrain.\n\n&gt; If possible they are kept outside, and their husbandry generally seems more like cold-blooded livestock rather than the typical squamate reptiles.\n\nYes, outdoor enclosures are the ideal we want to achieve. You should [read the first few pages of this](http://www.tortoisetrust.org/Downloads/Taking_care_of_pet_tortoises_web.pdf), if you don't know why.  \nComparing tortoises to livestock is funny (reptilian cows!) but not apt, in my opinion. I associate livestock with the production of goods such as milk and meat. That's not the case with tortoises. I hope.\n\nI think of them more like fish. **Not** that you put them in a glass tank like fish. But that you get to design a nice environment for them, and then distantly observe them living in that environment, rather than interact with them directly most of the time. If you enjoy gardening and landscaping, then great, building and \"furnishing\" a tortoise enclosure will be fun. If you don't, or if you want a cuddly pet, well, then better get a cat, dog, bunny, etc.  \nPlease note that I'm **not** saying that you shouldn't \"cuddle\" with your tortoise, or mustn't even touch it. You can, of course. But you don't have to. Yet another aspect that shows how different tortoises actually are from mammals: if you get a mammalian pet and never cuddle with it, that's silly, perhaps even cruel neglect; but with tortoises, it's okay, and some say even preferrable (\"each time you pick up a tortoise, you cause it stress\").\n\n&gt; Most squamates (lizards and snakes) are kept in a more controlled and seemingly clinical setting, with much less space, carefully controlled living parameters etc. Either tortoises can be kept like other reptiles or other reptiles are able to withstand the same conditions as tortoises, and people just don\u2019t recognize it\n\nOther reptiles would probably benefit from larger, more natural enclosures. But not everybody has enough space or even the possibility for an outdoor enclosure, e.g. people living in small apartments in cities. Time, money, and effort are also factors why people don't build better enclosures. Tortoises definitely and visibly benefit from outdoor life. Just look at all the lumpy shells from improperly raised indoor tortoises. Lamps are a poor substitute for sunlight, and especially UV lamps are a [tricky issue](https://np.reddit.com/r/turtle/comments/5wgvyi/say_hi_to_oogway/). \n\n&gt; Also tortoise keepers have a greater tendency to anthropomorphize their animals, to like saying what they like and what not, to like saying that they love the outdoors, to deem them very intelligent and affectionate even though there are many other reptiles that surpass them in intelligence, etc.\n\nDo you have any actual evidence that tortoise keepers have a greater tendency for that, or is that just your feeling? What you said there could be just as well said about many pet owners. Nothing special about pet tortoises there. I think that tortoise keepers with more than one or two animals tend to have a more pragmatic view. Particularly if they approach tortoise keeping like I described above, gardening and observing from a distance. I know my tortoises aren't humans, I even stopped naming them after the first 10 or so. ;)  \nIt is definitely true that they have likes and dislikes: they dislike not feeling any ground beneath their feet, and they like some food more than others, for example. And they also have different \"personalities\" - some are bold and curious, others more shy. I have a shy young tortoise that gets easily spooked and \"runs away\" to the nearest hiding spot when I approach; its siblings from the exact same clutch don't do that.\n\nIntelligence is a difficult subject. I wouldn't call tortoises particularly intelligent, but they aren't too dumb either. Also, what reptiles surpass them?\n\n&gt; They are the honorary herbivorous mammals of the reptile hobby.\n\nNot all of them are herbivores, and even those that supposedly are, are not above eating snails, insects, and even carrion when they get the opportunity. That shouldn't necessarily be encouraged in captivity, though.  \nIf you allow me another anecdote: one of my most memorable tortoise experiences was watching one of my young Hermann's tortoises (a herbivorous species) basking in its outdoor enclosure, when it suddenly spotted a pill-bug (woodlouse, roly-poly) walking on the ground - the tortoise *pursued* it for a few steps, and snatched it with a well-aimed bite. Would I have got to see that if I kept them indoors? Probably not.\n\n&gt; They just seem like they are non-reptiles. At least they seem like that to a \u2018normal\u2019 reptile keeper.\n\nThat might be true. They are quite special.\n\n&gt; The same might apply to a much lesser extent to aquatic turtles, although the latter are usually kept like other reptiles, in tanks and supporting equipment. Why is that the case?\n\nAgain, I think it comes down to space, money, effort, time. Many people simply don't have a garden large enough for a tortoise enclosure, or a turtle pond, or even live in a suitable climate zone.

Rosneft is owned by the russian government, so the money flowed from the russian central bank to the russian government.\n\nThere was no actual sale, as the purchasers are simply fiduciary shareholders.  In addition, rosneft was shopping this deal for years, and it was well known to the public.  James Bond simply took a true fact (that rosneft was shopping a 19% stake) and made up the story about the russian government offering to trade this to Trump in exchange for something.  \n\nHowever, people keep repeating the debunked claim that this \"proves\" trump is paid off by russia because the 19% in the phony dossier matches the 19% in the sham sale.\n\nThis story is based on a combination of the fact that everyone knew about this deal before the phony dossier, the author's sources in the russian government, rosneft, swiss banking, US banking, etc.  The author of this article is John Helmer, he is one of the most respected western journalists on the topic of Russia, and one of the only (maybe the only) western investigative journalist actually based in Russia.  Unlike James Bond, the author of the phony dossier who hasnt stepped foot in Russia in two decades, this guy lives there.\n\n[Here](https://www.thenation.com/article/kremlin-baiting-president-trump-without-facts-must-stop) is another link from one of the most respected US academics who studies Russia, former Princeton professor of Russian studies, contributing editor of The Nation (a left wing publication), and who is married to the editor of The Nation.  In other words, this guy is as liberal as they come, not even close to a Trump supporter.  He says this russia stuff is total garbage.\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BciYxlKfHH8) is an hour long interview with Stephen Cohen where he talks about this topic in depth.  I recommend listening to the whole thing, as he debunks the Michael Flynn conspiracy theories as well.  Again, this guy is a hard core liberal.  He isnt a Trump supporter by any means.\n\n[Here](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/12/tell-russia-hacked-election.html) is a post from yet another expert who explains why the intelligence community's claims that Russia hacked the DNC are 100% total garbage.\n\n[Here](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/25/seymour-hersh-blasts-media-for-uncritically-promoting-russian-hacking-story/) is the best living investigative reporter on the planet, the guy who broke the My Lai massacre and the Abu Ghraib story among other scandals, pulitzer prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh.  He says this is garbage.  Again, this isnt a Trump supporter, he even bashes Trump for other things in this interview.\n\nThe people who are promoting this Trump-Russia conspiracy theory are peddling fake news, period.

When I finally made it to the surface, another large wave drilled me and I only had enough time to draw half a breath. At this point I was getting a little panicky. Being around the water as much as I had, I knew the worst thing I could do was panic. When you start running out of oxygen, panic sets in. When I made to the surface this time, I got about as much foam in my mouth as air and another wave took me back to the bottom. I was exhausted from struggling and pretty aware that I wasn't going to make it. Then this warm feeling came over my entire body and I felt nothing but calm. The closest I can compare it to is like eating a couple of valium and drinking a glass of wine. I was completely relaxed and completely at peace. Somehow, I popped up to the surface and there was a lull in the waves. I threw up a bunch of seawater and swam in.

You can get more exact coloring with acrylic, but spray paint is SO much easier.\n\nI also highly recommend getting some sticky tack (the blue stuff teachers use in the US), and taking the time to stick each piece to a piece of cardboard.

The movement began in the midst of an intense revolution in society where flaming nationalism filled the hearts of all Lavinthians as they came to believe that they were at the forefront of the world, leading it into greatness. This was largely supported by the fact that Lavinthians are the primary magic users in Ladrisea, which is explained with their religion of Aiusism. All of these feelings lead to the belief that the culture, language, religion, and even measurements of Lavinthia should be spread worldwide. Of course, resistance to this cultural conversion was met, so the Lavinthian military and the Grand Circle of Prophets (the organized church of Aiusism) were heavily involved in the process. Even after the century of aggressive culture-spreading, most nations kept their cultures in tact, although Lavinthia emerged as a worldwide empire with an entire continent conquered and suppressed.","gilded":0,"score":1}

The ballot is torn off and your signature is left behind as a stub that they keep (that way the number of stubs can be compared to number of ballots cast to make sure there isn't someone working at the polls filling out extra ballots. It's a way to verify the number of votes cast equals the number of voters who voted without forcing people to show who they voted for.

The ballot is read by the machine and comes up with totals based on the readings. Then the results are reported to the capital so the numbers can come in. The machines have memory cards that are kept so that if necessary in the future the memory card can be checked against the actual ballots themselves to make sure there is no one tampering with shit.\n\nIn order to commit fraud youd have to do it through early voting mail in ballots like what happened in broward county (debbie wassermannl schults district) where they \"accidentally\"sent out the mail in ballots missing one page so they had to send out a second ballot with all pages.

{"author":"Neosonic97","parent_id":"t1_dec3nj7","subreddit":"whowouldwin","distinguished":null,"body":"&gt;Are you serious? That is such a fucking lie. Naruto even fucking summoned his cloak first, to create a chakra avatar. Like, what, is his body made of fucking jelly for it to be waving around like that?\n\nConsidering not once was Naruto seen in the Chakra Construct of Kurama in The Last (Despite the fact that he SHOULD be visible, mind you, given that chakra avatars are transparent), and in fact the next scene SHOWS Naruto explicitly outside of the avatar's body (Because he's riding on one of Sai's crows). Yes, Naruto goes KCM before bringing out Kurama, HOWEVER, your argument about him making a Shadow Clone with the avatar CANNOT ring true in The Last, as Naruto never made the hand sign for his Shadow Clones, and Naruto is onscreen when Kurama actually comes out. No hand-signs were made Even then, saying it's a chakra avatar isn't much as Tailed Beasts are just huge portions of the Chakra of the Ten-Tails given personality and form. What I'm saying is that since Kurama's body remained AFTER Naruto reverted from KCM (And Kurama himself lost the KCM-like appearance afterwards, hence why his body was not wavering in the scene where he writes on the moon [NOTE THE DIFFERENCE IN APPEARANCE]). This would ALSO explain why Naruto would not be able to use KCM2 or Six Paths Sage Mode- because Kurama wouldn't be able to spare much Chakra, because he was using most of it to keep the Statue of the Otsutsuki clan at bay.\n\n&gt;Where do you see similarities?\n\nThe general shape of the markings on the torso is closer to KCM1's (Only larger, likely to signify that it's full kurama rather than just his yin or yang half), his torso isn't black (Which is different from every other seen usage of a KCM-related form aside from KCM1), AND the magatama markings around his neck fit KCM1's to a tee.\n\n&gt;Which, until it gets the upgrade from all the Tailed Beasts, wasn't keeping up at all with Naruto's Chakra Avatar. Hell, she could only barely win over Naruto in a Chakra Fist fight.\n\nNowhere in that scan does it imply that Kaguya 'barely' won. In fact, given how Naruto was sent flying in that scan, I'd say he cleanly lost that clash- mostly because he was trying to distract Kaguya for Sasuke to strike. (Hence why the scan in question even has Naruto signal to Sasuke \"Now, Sasuke!\", after he lost the clash. Leading to Sasuke's Susano'o getting wasted.).\n\nRead the manga again, because Rinnegan Sasuke's Susano'o DID keep up with Six Paths Sage Mode Naruto's Kurama avatar. You say it wasn't keeping up but the manga contradicts this. It clearly was. Best exemplified by pages 16 through 18 of chapter 695, where it clashed Naruto's Bijuudama with a Chidori. When it got the amp, it completely OUTCLASSED Naruto's Kurama avatar.","score":1,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1488326375,"author_flair_css_class":"0505","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_5wcnfs","edited":1488326825,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s599","stickied":false,"retrieved_on":1489223597,"id":"decf1v1","author_flair_text":""}

{"gilded":0,"score":2,"body":"1. Probably the Silent Realms. They were actually pretty challenging, and I thought it added a cool new depth to the game. I remember how scared I was the first time I set off the guardians. \n\n2. Gotta be Ancient Cistern because of the boss. Super cool fight. \n\n3. [Romance in the Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7egFhuObEo). Incredibly light-hearted track that set a surprising tone between Link and Zelda. The moment with Link and Zelda flying through the air together struck me as one of the most tender scenes in the entire franchise, and the music was a big reason for that.  \n\n4. The final battle with Ghirahim, and running down the spire and slashing up hoards of Bokoblin was one of the most adrenaline filled fights I've ever experienced. \n\n5. They had been saying after Twilight Princess that they wanted to \"break the traditional conventions of the Zelda formula\" and I think this game starts as the turning point for that. You can see them testing the waters with things like the stamina bar, the shield durability system, and the motion controls, that they were testing the waters with this game. And I think more than anything, the fact that the tone for this game is a love story, makes it much more endearing, and compelling to complete. There's a sense of urgency to save Zelda, arguably more so than previous games. It becomes an onus to save not just the land of Hyrule and Skyloft, but also the girl Link loves. So personally, I felt the writing was the strongest aspect of this game, and why I think it's a necessary game to play.

Countries without guns have just as much violence with the exception of Japan due to their strong unique culture and utterly barbaric prisons.\n\nThis is entirely wrong. The US has an ENORMOUS crime rate far higher than any other developed country. Here's a graph:\n\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/images/International/homocides_g8_countries_640x360_wmain.jpg\n\nhttps://i0.wp.com/blog.skepticallibertarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/America-is-violent-graph.png?resize=300%2C245\n\nGun reform (beginning in the 80s) massively reduced gun deaths in Australia, particularly from suicide. We've not entirely banned firearms, just made it difficult and expensive to get them. The guns per capita rate has plummeted and the gun crime rate with it. We have a much safer society; people are far safer. Only the US has taken a different approach, thanks to their enormously powerful gun lobby paying off many politicians.\n\nJapan does not have barbaric prisons, and I'm not sure where you got that idea. Their prison system is probably comparable to the American one, though less severe and less corrupt.\n\nJapanese culture is not unique.\n\n&gt; Globalists want to ban guns because you have no sovereignty when nobody can defend themselves.\n\nGuns are not effective for this purpose, sadly. In 100 years, no revolutionary group has successfully overthrown a fascist government by using guns - only fascists groups overthrowing democratic governments.","gilded":0,"score":1,"parent_id":"t1_debk46r","subreddit":"changemyview","author":"LtFred","distinguished":null,"controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_5pk4uj","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1488326377}

Two problems happen, being too stupid to admit their mistake and moving straight to a new design and more importantly, they now have an engine running with a car in season, it needs fixing because it's both terrible and tarnishing the companies reputation. SO now you need to build a new engine but a huge portion(maybe a large majority) of your resources are now working on fixing the existing engine rather than designing a better one.\n\nThe guy in charge was let go/retired in what April or so last year, they'd doubled down on the shitty idea, the new guy said they had an upgrade plan to follow for a while and they'd see how that went, then a couple months later said yeah, this ain't going to work and we'll probably work on a new concept.\n\nSo now they have a second rushed engine with a new concept that was probably started around May/June time frame. \n\nIt's going to be a billion times easier to develop away from the track without so many resources dedicated to fixing a shit engine. \n\nMclaren utterly fucked up in their insistence they had to move in 2015. They should have been sneaky motherfuckers and signed with Honda in quiet and come in for 2016 at the earliest. \n\nThe other issue was Ron's rigidity, he wanted size zero, not only did he demand a massively rushed engine he demanded it fit within a tiny fecking package. A big hint is making shit smaller is more difficult, rushing an engineering project and adding a design limit which made that project even harder is just fucking stupid. \n\nEverything about the project is stupid and when you start out so bad again due to the trying to fix the current engine you'll always be at a massive disadvantage. Honda fucked up, but most of their fuck up started when they said yes to the project, for me Ron's constraints on time and style of engine had Honda fucked from day one.","score":5,"gilded":0,"author":"TwoBionicknees","parent_id":"t1_deby9sm","subreddit":"formula1","distinguished":null,"id":"decf23e","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qimj","stickied":false,"retrieved_on":1489223600,"edited":false}

{"gilded":0,"score":1,"body":"I think you may be misreading the policy limits available to you. If the person that hit you has 25/50 BI policy limits that means, his or insurance company will pay each injured person $25,000.00 of pain and suffering, medical bills and lost wages. No person can recover more than $25,000.00. \n\nThe \"50\" stands for the amount that the insurance company can be totally liable for the accident per accident. See this article on [Louisiana BI (bodily injury) policy limits](http://lawyerdon.com/2017/02/bi-limits-in-louisiana/).  Although your accident may not have happened in Louisiana, the way policy limits are read does not differ from state to state. \n\nIf the BI limits in your case are 25/50, that means the most that each occupant of your vehicle can recover is $25,000.  The total amount the the insurance can be liable for bodily injury cannot not exceed $50,000.00 total no matter if the value of damages exceeds $50,000.00. \n\nThere is a separate number on the policy that handles property damage. It's usually the third number. So a policy that reads: 25/50/50, would mean that the insurance company can be liable for $50,000.00 of property damage in addition to 25/50 in bodily injury. You could call and ask the insurance adjuster the numbers again, or ask a copy of the policy declaration page, or hire a personal injury attorney to help you. \n\nDisclaimer: the above is not meant to form an attorney client relationship.

In fact they have put together evidence that shows levels rising and falling consistently within a set range for a large period of time before humans existed. It's only really after the industrial revolution that a noticable rise in global temperatures takes place. This is when humans learned to exploit fossils fules. Levels of green house gases have never been higher than they are currently. Record extremes in weather that were predicted in the 90's are happening globally. To me it's the overwhelming amount of evidence that points to humans having the most impact on environment in millions of years of historical climate data.

This would allow devs to work on actually improving the gameplay experience in order to make money, rather than developing something they need to sell directly.\n\n- Tight budged forcing a rushed release, combined with too small or incompetent tech team which makes the game still runs like shit 4 years after release, even on modern hardware."}
